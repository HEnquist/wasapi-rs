//! # Wasapi bindings for Rust
//!
//! The aim of this crate is to provide easy and safe access to the Wasapi API for audio playback and capture.
//!
//! The presented API is all safe Rust, but structs and functions closely follow the original Windows API.
//!
//! For details on how to use Wasapi, please see [the Windows documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/coreaudio/core-audio-interfaces).
//!
//! Bindings are generated automatically using the [windows](https://crates.io/crates/windows) crate.
//!
//! ## Supported functionality
//!
//! These things have been implemented so far:
//!
//! - Audio playback and capture
//! - Shared and exclusive modes
//! - Loopback capture
//! - Notifications for volume change, device disconnect etc
//!
//! ## Included examples
//!
//! | Example    | Description                                                    |
//! | ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `playsine` | Plays a sine wave in shared mode on the default output device. |
//! | `playsine_events` | Similar to `playsine` but also listens to notifications. |
//! | `loopback` | Shows how to simultaneously capture and render sound, with separate threads for capture and render. |
//! | `record` | Records audio from the default device, and saves the raw samples to a file. |
